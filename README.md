<h1> Meme Generator</h1>
Welcome to my meme generator project! This is a small project I created to practice using HTML canvas and implementing responsive design. The meme generator allows you to easily add your own text to popular memes or create your own unique memes from scratch.

The project is built using vanilla JavaScript and HTML canvas, which provides powerful image processing capabilities for generating high-quality memes. Give it a try and see what kind of hilarious memes you can create!
